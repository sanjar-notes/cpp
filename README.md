# cpp

## Why C++
Why did I learn instead of Java, JavaScript, Python which are used for real programs, and are needed in jobs.
I did learn them, but started with C++ because:
1. Familiarity: It was the first language I learnt in college.
2. Primitives of computing: Helps understand memory (an after thought), stack and heap, allocation and deallocation.
3. Easy going: Does not force a programming paradigm (style) like OOP (like Java), so is easier to get started as a beginner.
4. OOP: You can do OOP if you need to. Needed for large programs, and interviews
5. Standard library: Has a good standard library - STL, unlike JavaScript which does not have a comprehensive data structure library, especially heaps, lower_bound, upper_bound.

## Topics covered here
1. Basics - variables, loops
2. Memory - pointers, references
3. OOP - classes, constructors, objects, templates

## Current usage
I work in JavaScript. But use C++ for interviews, because I know it and picking Java would be a waste of time at this time.

I'm learning TypeScript these days, because types are needed in apps for productivity.

React, React native and Node are my tools as of now
